  "readme": "# UltraREPL\r\n\r\nThe goal of UltraREPL is to be a JavaScript development environment, not just a toy or a simple debugger. Developing JS code inside of JavaScript itself enables a lot of powerful options that are otherwise difficult or cumbersome. The problem is Node's existing REPL doesn't provide the tools needed to take advantage of this potential, and there's not really any other options aside from (albiet awesome) browser based environments like [Ace](http://ace.ajax.org/).\r\n\r\nAlso see http://benvie.github.com/continuum/ for a similar web-based interface that uses a JavaScript bytecode virtual machine built in JavaScript. It allows deep debugging like inspecting local contexts, opcodes, and engine internals.\r\n\r\n# Installation and Startup\r\n\r\nUltraREPL is designed to work with zero configuration as long as Node is installed. To get it you can clone it from this repo or simply install it with npm:\r\n```\r\nnpm install ultra-repl\r\n```\r\nIf installed with npm it should be set up to run in your path. I've yet to see this work in Windows, however, so I've tried to make it as easy as possible regardless. For direct loading you can go to `ultra-repl/bin` where you'll find the .js file which can be run directly on OS X or Linux, and a .cmd file which can be run like an executable on Windows.\r\n\r\nYou should be greeted with something similar to this upon starting it:\r\n\r\n![startup](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Basic Usage\r\n\r\nTo begin with it has all the features Node's built-in REPL does. You write JavaScript, it evaluates it and shows the result. The simplest command is `this` which will spit out the global context and everything in it. The formatting differences are immediately obvious.\r\n\r\n![this](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Commands & Keybindings\r\n\r\nIn the module folder is a `settings` folder with the `controls.js` file.\r\n\r\nUltraREPL supports fully customizable keybindings that provide a lot of room to speed up workflow. Every user exposed command can be bound to any set of keys or a repl keyword. ctrl+alt+shift+key combos are possible for a keys excluding number pad. F keys works. All of the default handlers have been removed so that signal interrupts are customizable or skippable.\r\n\r\nBeyond normal keybindings, UltraREPL also supports what I'm calling Cadances. That is a set of keybindings executed in order to create a new binding. For example, the default bindings have Clear Input as `esc`, Clear Window as `esc esc` and Quit as `esc esc esc`. Similar to how the sig interrupt functions, but fully customizable with any combination of keys, any amount in order, and to execute any command. Simply string keybinds together with spaces to indicate a Cadance.\r\n\r\nCurrent defaults:\r\n\r\n![defaults](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nToggling hiddens and builtins.\r\n\r\n![hiddens](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss2.png)\r\n\r\n![no builtins](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contexts\r\n\r\nOn startup the context is set to the default global one where Node initializes itself and where nearly all things usually run under normal usage. From here you keep using the global context or create a new one by hitting the keybind (F1 shows the commands). When a context is created it immediately is switched to. At this point all commands and actions which will be run in this context as if it is the one and only global one. Creating, switching, deleting, and resetting contexts is done by a keybinds and is always instantaneous.\r\n\r\nThere are some things that are (currently) shared between contexts. Required modules, `process`, the various `ArrayBuffer` constructors, Node's `Buffer`, and the four timer functions, because currently Node doesn't provide a good way to make multiple copies. In the near future it will be changed, one way or another, so that nothing is required to be shared between contexts. Right now it's not required those items be copied, it's simply that if they are to be in multiple contexts then they are shared.\r\n\r\nEverything else is unique per context: native objects and any code you run yourself. It is generally possible to put objects on multiple contexts but there are some things that don't work, like trying to run Object.* functions from one context on objects in another one. The settings for depth, hiddens, builtins, and colors are also specific to each context.\r\n\r\nYou can make and use as many contexts as you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Local Scope\r\n\r\nEach context has a local scope object that contains variables not found on its global object or anywhere in the context, but are accessible from code run in the REPL. This works similarly to Node's module, `exports`, `require`, `__dirname`, and `__filename`. The difference is that you can change what's on the local context using the `.local` command.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Default Local Scope](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss11.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Set Local Scope to require(\"fs\") just because](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss12.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\nNew Global detection.\r\n\r\n![New Globals](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss7.png)\r\n\r\n## Useful Error Display\r\n\r\n![Error Display](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss10.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Syntax Highlighting\r\n\r\nEvaluation results which are functions with readable source will be returned as syntax hightlighted code, utilizing aspects of CodeMirror2 along with modifications to work in the console.\r\n\r\n![Syntax Hightlighting 1](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Syntax Hightlighting 2](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss8.png)\r\n\r\n## Integrated npm search and usage\r\n\r\n![Syntax Hightlighting 3](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss6.png)\r\n\r\n![Syntax Hightlighting 3](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss13.png)\r\n\r\n![Syntax Hightlighting 3](https://raw.github.com/Benvie/Node.js-Ultra-REPL/master/docs/ss14.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## In Progress\r\n\r\nOnce the file system interface is more fleshed out I'll be able to accomplish the following pretty quickly:\r\n\r\n* GUI-like interface with collapsable object views\r\n* State/setting indicators\r\n* Multi-line code input so you can actually develop in this\r\n* Better tools for saving/loading/editing/running code from files\r\n* Tools to easily add and edit commands/modules for the REPL itself\r\n* Integration with external tools like npm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Brandon Benvie <brandon@bbenvie.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
